COVID-19 Classroom Policy
=========================


----------------
Classroom Policy
----------------


The university has a requirement to use a face covering
when in indoor spaces in order to contribute to
the health and safety of the OSU community during the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Accordingly, you are expected to use a face covering when attending class.


Our classroom policy is that everyone in the classroom must wear their face covering properly to start an in-person lecture.
An in-person lecture will be canceled if anyone does not follow the university's face covering requirement because having an in-person class is dangerous under such a condition.
In such a case, only the lecture video will be posted on YouTube. (the lecture videos will be available even if we do an in-person lecture).


Please contact me before class if you have concerns with
meeting this expectation.
I encourage you to review the Policy yourself,
to understand the university's expectations around the use of
face coverings outside the classroom,
OSU's Vaccination requirement,
and OSU's isolation and quarantine requirements.

University Requirement
----------------------

OSU requires the use of face coverings in indoor spaces, as well as outdoor spaces where physical distancing is not feasible. Face coverings are defined as an item affixed to the face to help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus, including cloth garments that cover the nose and mouth, and medical-grade disposable masks. This definition and policy exclude face coverings that incorporate a valve to facilitate easy exhalation, mesh masks, lace masks, face shields or other coverings with openings, holes, or visible gaps in the design, material or vents.
