Course description
------------------
This is an introductory course on cybersecurity with
an objective to introduce concepts and principles of
computer sytems security.

This course covers various things in cybersecurity, such as:

.. code-block:: c

    1) basic cryptographic primitives and their applications,
    2) establishing secure channel over a network,
    3) user/multi-factor/biometric authentications,
    4) web security,
    5) software security,
    6) malware, phishing, privacy and others,


through ten-weeks with hands-on micro-assignments.

This course borrows the format of
`Capture-The-Flag (CTF) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag>`__
challenges for not only applying knowledge and techniques from textbook
to real systems but also enjoying the fun of playing with them.

------------
Prerequisite
------------
- Operating Systems I (required, CS 344 at OSU)
- Linux System Administration (recommended, CS 312 at OSU)


--------------
Class meetings
--------------

- When: Tu&Th 14:00-15:50 (2:00pm-3:50pm)
- Where: `Kearney 112 <https://map.oregonstate.edu/?building=Kear>`__

------------
Office hours
------------

We will have office hours at KEC 3079 from 17:30 to 19:00
(this could be changed at the instructor's discretion).

In case you cannot make the office hour, feel free to ask questions on
the discord, at the corresponding channel to the topic of the question.

----------------------
Who should take CS 370
----------------------

CS 370 Introduction to Security is primarily intended for
undergraduate students who are first-time learners of cybersecurity.

Over the course of the lectures and micro-assignment exercises,
students will learn both the theory and practices of
the modern cybersecurity techniques.


--------------
Grading policy
--------------

- 60% micro-assignments, 20% quizzes, 20% `NSA Codebreaker Challenge (Task 0, A1, A2, B1, B2, 5 & 6) <https://nsa-codebreaker.org/home>`__
- No midterm or final exams.
- See `Rules <rules.html>`__.

-----------------
Online Discussion
-----------------

Online discussion is strongly encouraged, and it will help you
a lot in solving each week's micro-assignments.

Please join `Discord <https://discord.gg/KbnnWNCr2k>`__ to ask questions and
get answer interactively.

-----------------
Misconduct Policy
-----------------

CS 370 Introduction to Security provides a **7** day grace period (50% points after due date, only for 7 days.)
and we strictly follow the plagiarism policy
(read `OSU's Student Conduct CODE <http://leadership.oregonstate.edu/sites/leadership.oregonstate.edu/files/policies/student_conduct_2-25-15_576-15.pdf>`__).

.. important::

    **Cheating vs. collaboration**

    Collaboration is a very good thing. On the other hand, cheating is
    considered a very serious offense and is vigorously prosecuted.
    Vigorous prosecution requires that you be advised of
    the cheating policy of the course before the offending act.

    For this semester, the policy is simple: don’t cheat:
        - *Never* share code or text on the project.
        - *Never* use someone else’s code or text in your solutions.
        - *Never* consult potential solutions on the Internet.

    On the other hand, for this class, you are strongly encouraged to:
        - Share ideas.
        - Explain your code to someone to see if they know why it doesn’t work.
        - Help someone else debug if they've run into a wall.

    If you obtain help of any kind, always **write the name(s) of your sources**.
