Never forget to smile.
Keep looking up... that's the secret of life.
Be yourself. No one can say you're doing it wrong.
Everyone understands kindness.
Never stress on what you can't control and never worry about what isn't yours.
The less you want, the more you love.
I donâ€™t have time to worry about who doesn't like me. I'm too busy loving the people who love me.
Each of us has his own calling.
I think I'm allergic to morning.
Has It Ever Occurred to You That You Might Be Wrong?
I can't... I'm thinking about pizza.
Quite often lately I have the feeling I don't know what's going on.
