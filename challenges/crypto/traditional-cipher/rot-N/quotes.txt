Never forget to smile.
Keep looking up... that's the secret of life.
Be yourself. No one can say you're doing it wrong.
Everyone understands kindness.
Never stress on what you can't control and never worry about what isn't yours.
The less you want, the more you love.
I donâ€™t have time to worry about who doesn't like me. I'm too busy loving the people who love me.
Each of us has his own calling.
I think I'm allergic to morning.
Has It Ever Occurred to You That You Might Be Wrong?
I can't... I'm thinking about pizza.
Quite often lately I have the feeling I don't know what's going on.
Rats... I forgot what I was going to say.
Unfortunately, it's very hard to forget anyone by drinking root beer.
My mind reels with sarcastic replies.
I don't know why I look at the menu... I always order the same thing.
Tell them I'm busy.
Dear IRS, Please remove me from your mailing list.
My life has no purpose, no direction, no aim, no meaning, and yet I'm happy. I can't figure it out. What am I doing right?
When life knocks you down, roll over and look at the stars.
Just thinking about a friend makes you want to do a happy dance.
I love when you're here.
A friend is someone who loves you in spite of your faults.
Jogging is very beneficial. It's good for your legs and your feet. It's also very good for the ground. It makes it feel needed.
Friendship is doing nothing special and enjoying it.
