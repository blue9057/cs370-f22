Message Authentication Code

Altering the ciphertext -> vulnerability in the usage of cryptography
How can we not allow attackers change the code?


Cryptographic Hash function
    a one-way function that returns a pseudo-random number based on the input

Characteristics
    Must be quick to calculate H(x) for a given x.
    for any x,y where x == y, H(x) == H(y).
    for any R, it must be very hard to find x that yields R == H(x)
    for any x, it must be very hard to find y where x != y and H(x) == H(y)
    for a given x, even if a small change was applied to x', the result need to
    be unrelated to the previous value x (avalanche effect)

How we can use this function?
    One-way function, and hard to compute its inverse
        H(secret || message) => some hash value H(sm)
        H([don't know secret] || message) => can't never be the same as H(sm)
        H(some_other_number) => it's hard to be H(sm)
