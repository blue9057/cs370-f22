Perfect Secrecy is good
Implication
    The resulting ciphertext will always look like a random number
    -> no matter what kind of plaintext you supply to the encryption
    -> no matter what kind of key you use (if drawn randomly)
    -> attackers cannot distinguish whether the observed communication
    -> is ciphertext or a random number

However, achieving the perfect secrecy is difficult
key-size == message size
key cannot be re-used
    for 1GB data, we need an 1GB key
    we need to hand the key securely
    then, how about hand the data securely than the key??


What we wish to have
    Can we have a short key K (e.g., 16- or 32-bytes) to
    encrypt a long message M (e.g., 1GB or more)
    but still our ciphertext C looks like random?

Block cipher
Model
    message     M
    key         K
    ciphertext  C
    (introduce the IV later)
